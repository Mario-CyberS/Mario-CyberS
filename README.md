I began my professional journey at the age of 14 as an apprentice home inspector, developing my expertise in residential and commercial property inspection. After securing my home inspector's license, I became a lead inspector with one of the top inspection companies in Tallahassee, Florida, while also pursuing my studies at Florida State University (FSU).

Alongside my property inspection career, I have maintained a deep passion for technology, particularly computer systems related to cyber security analysis, engineering, and penetration testing. I have dedicated myself to mastering various programming languages and operating systems, continuously expanding my skill set, and never finished learning. My goal is to transition into a cyber security-focused role, specifically as a Tier 1 Cyber Security Engineer/Analyst, where I can apply my knowledge and contribute to the security landscape.

## Objective
My journey in computer science has led me to develop a strong foundation in cyber security. I am actively seeking opportunities to work in a cyber department environment as a Tier 1 Cyber Security Analyst/Engineer, where I can leverage my skills in security monitoring, incident response, and automation to help protect organizations from cyber threats.
