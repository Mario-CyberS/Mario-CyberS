# Hello, I'm Mario Tagaras
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-gt" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am a driven Cyber Security enthusiast with hands-on professional experience in SIEM deployment/configuration, scripting, back-up automation, threat log analysis, network/endpoint hardening. I spent a year as a Cyber Security Analyst Intern at Diverse Computing, Inc., where I deployed and tuned Wazuh (open-source) SIEMs, on RHEL/Almalinux servers for centralized log aggregation, as well as threat detection/alerting. I also deployed numerous Wazuh agents across plenty of endpoints/devices for close agent-based monitoring looking for things like FIM, Configuration Assessment, & Threat Hunting. I've automated ASA firewall backups using Python/Bash scripts I wrote and hardened, for the Networking team to pull from when needed, along side working with tools like Zabbix for monitoring and automation disruption alerting.

I also continuously run a homelab where I build secure networking environments using Raspberry Pi as a firewall/NAT relay for my personal Windows desktop, Tailscale as a VPN for private device network, and Mullvad as a traffic exit node for my Pi. One of my key projects is the Automated Cyberscan Orchestrator, a collaborative design with a co-developer to automate bug bounty reconnaissance. It uses Python/Selenium/undetected-chromedriver to scrape for bounty targets from targeted bounty program sites, routes findings through an LLM for context-aware tool selection, and safely automates the execution of recon tools based on the given data and thought analysis, ending with a well organized automated report generation ready for review, with plans to implement a CMP server for proper workflow orchestration, this would lay the groundwork for scalable, automated/orchestrated vulnerability workflows.

I am CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 certified and am currently studying for the CompTIA CySa+ CS0-003 certification exam. I am actively hunting for an entry-level role as an SOC Analyst or Cyber Security Analyst, or relevant roles. I am passionate about Cyber Security monitoring/detection/response automated/manual work flows, and international regulation compliance. This would include CISA‚Äôs SIEM/SOAR guidelines for proper implementation and use, alongside compliance with government regulations like NIST 800-171, HIPPA, PCI DSS, FERPA, GDPR, etc.

It includes installing RHEL 9.5 minimal iso, installing VMware workstation, deploying RHEL VM, installing Wazuh, and accessing the Wazuh Web UI for real-time security monitoring.

#### [Syslog Wazuh Configuration](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Syslog-Wazuh-Configuration/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project details how to configure Wazuh SIEM and rsyslog on a RHEL-based system to ingest syslog data from a Cisco ASA firewall. It covers editing the Wazuh ossec.conf, creating a dedicated log file, adjusting rsyslog rules, and verifying log ingestion for real-time network traffic monitoring.

#### [Logrotate Wazuh ASA.log](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Logrotate-Wazuh-ASA.log/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project outlines how to configure a custom logrotate policy on a RHEL-based Wazuh server to automatically rotate, compress, and manage the siteasa.log file that stores Cisco ASA firewall logs. It includes crontab scheduling for daily rotation and service restart handling to ensure uninterrupted log ingestion.

#### [Indexer Tuning and ISM Wazuh](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Indexer-Tuning-and-ISM-Wazuh/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project focuses on optimizing the Wazuh Indexer for a single-node setup by tuning shard counts, replica settings, index lifecycle policies (ISM), and increasing heap memory usage to avoid cluster overload and log ingestion issues.

#### [Wazuh Agent Deployment](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Wazuh-Agent-Deployment/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project provides step-by-step instructions for deploying and configuring Wazuh agents on endpoint machines and managing agent connections to the Wazuh Manager. It also covers agent removal using the CLI.

#### [Mullvad as Tailscale Exit Node](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Mullvad-as-Tailscale-Exit-Node/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project documents how to configure a Raspberry Pi to act as a secure internet gateway for a connected PC using Mullvad VPN (via WireGuard) while still allowing remote access over Tailscale. It ensures all PC traffic is routed through Mullvad, while preserving RDP and SSH access from a MacBook using Tailscale.

### ‚ô¶Ô∏è Automated Orchestration of Cyberscan Tools:

#### [Automated Cyberscan Orchestrator](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Automated-Cyberscan-Orchestrator/edit/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project builds an automated framework for discovering and testing bug bounty targets by orchestrating scraping, AI-driven tool recommendations, recon scanning, and report generation. It leverages Python modules to extract bounty data, route it through an LLM for optimal tool selection, and safely run reconnaissance tools; laying the foundation for fully automated vulnerability reporting workflows. Future enhancements include the integration of a CMP (Command Management Platform) server to coordinate task dispatching, tool execution, and job tracking across distributed agents.
