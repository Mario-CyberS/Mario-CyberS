# Hello, I'm Mario Tagaras
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-gt" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am a driven Cyber Security enthusiast with hands-on experience in SIEM deployment/configuration, scripting, back-up automation, threat log analysis, network/endpoint hardening. I spent a year as a Cyber Security Analyst Intern at Diverse Computing, Inc., where I deployed and tuned Wazuh (open-source) SIEMs, on RHEL/Almalinux servers for centralized log aggregation, as well as threat detection/alerting. I also deployed numerous Wazuh agents across plenty of endpoints/devices for close agent-based monitoring like FIM log collection. I've automated ASA firewall backups using Python/Bash scripts I wrote and hardened, along side working with tools like Zabbix for monitoring and automation disruption alerting.

I also continuously run a homelab where I build secure networking environments using Raspberry Pi as a firewall/NAT setup, Tailscale as a VPN for private device network, and Mullvad as a traffic exit node. One of my key projects is the Automated Cyberscan Orchestrator, a collaborative design with a co-developer to automate bug bounty reconnaissance. It uses Python/Selenium/undetected-chromedriver to scrape for bounty targets from targeted bounty program sites, routes findings through an LLM for context-aware tool selection, and safely automates the execution of recon tools based on the given data and thought analysis, ending with a well organized automated report generation ready for review, with plans to implement a CMP server for proper orchestration, this would lay the groundwork for scalable, automated vulnerability workflows.

I am CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 certified and currently studying for my CySa+ certification. I am actively hunting for an entry-level role as an SOC Analyst or Cyber Security Analyst. I am passionate about Cyber Security monitoring/detection/response automated and manual work flows, and international regulation compliance. This would include CISA‚Äôs SIEM/SOAR guidelines for proper implementation and use, alongside compliance with government regulations like NIST 800-171, HIPPA, PCI DSS, FERPA, GDPR, etc.

#### [Syslog Wazuh Configuration](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Syslog-Wazuh-Configuration/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project details how to configure Wazuh SIEM and rsyslog on a RHEL-based system to ingest syslog data from a Cisco ASA firewall. It covers editing the Wazuh ossec.conf, creating a dedicated log file, adjusting rsyslog rules, and verifying log ingestion for real-time network traffic monitoring.

#### [Logrotate Wazuh ASA.log](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Logrotate-Wazuh-ASA.log/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project outlines how to configure a custom logrotate policy on a RHEL-based Wazuh server to automatically rotate, compress, and manage the siteasa.log file that stores Cisco ASA firewall logs. It includes crontab scheduling for daily rotation and service restart handling to ensure uninterrupted log ingestion.

#### [Indexer Tuning and ISM Wazuh](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Indexer-Tuning-and-ISM-Wazuh/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project focuses on optimizing the Wazuh Indexer for a single-node setup by tuning shard counts, replica settings, index lifecycle policies (ISM), and increasing heap memory usage to avoid cluster overload and log ingestion issues.

#### [Wazuh Agent Deployment](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Wazuh-Agent-Deployment/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project provides step-by-step instructions for deploying and configuring Wazuh agents on endpoint machines and managing agent connections to the Wazuh Manager. It also covers agent removal using the CLI.
