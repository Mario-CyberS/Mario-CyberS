I began my professional journey at the age of 14 as an apprentice home inspector, developing my expertise in residential and commercial property inspection. After securing my home inspector's license, I became a lead inspector with one of the top inspection companies in Tallahassee, Florida, while also pursuing my studies at Florida State University (FSU).

Alongside my property inspection career, I have kept a deep passion for technology, particularly computer systems related to cyber security analysis, engineering, and penetration testing. I have dedicated myself to mastering the navigation and configuration of numerous operating systems, to continuously expand my skill set, and to never finish learning. My current goal is to transition into a cyber security focused role, specifically as a Tier 1 Cyber Security Engineer/Analyst, where I can apply my knowledge and contribute to the fast pace security industry. As well as my studies, I currently use most of my time working as a FL licensed Home Inspector and as a Jr Cyber Security Analyst with Diverse Computing, Inc. I have been with Diverse Computing, Inc. for a year during my last year as an FSU student, learning what it means to be a Cyber Security Specialist. I have immensly grown in experience and knowledge during my time with DCI, and I am greatful for it. My time as an intern has come to an end and I am now on the pursuit for an entry level job in the Cyber sector. I am currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ certificate to launch off my certificate collection journey, along side my continuous retention of up-to-date cyber news.

## üíº Experience
- 1 year internship at Diverse Computing, Inc. as a JR Cyber Security Analyst.
- Homelab projects that include things like SIEM, cyber security tools, & Virtual Machine creation and maintenance.

## üìú Certificates 
- In progress of studying for CompTIA Security+

## üéØ Objective
My journey in computer science has led me to develop a strong foundation in cyber security. I am actively seeking opportunities to work in a cyber department environment as a Tier 1 Cyber Security Analyst/Engineer, where I can leverage my skills in security monitoring, incident response, and automation to help protect organizations from cyber threats.

## üöÄ Projects  

### üîπ Wazuh SIEM Project:

#### [Deploying Wazuh SIEM](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Deploying-Wazuh-SIEM/blob/main/README.md)  
**Description:** This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of setting up a **Wazuh SIEM Manager** on a **RHEL VM** using **VMware Workstation 17**. It includes installing RHEL 9.5 minimal iso, installing VMware workstation, deploying RHEL VM, installing Wazuh, and accessing the Wazuh Web UI for real-time security monitoring.

#### [Syslog Wazuh Configuration](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Syslog-Wazuh-Configuration/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project details how to configure Wazuh SIEM and rsyslog on a RHEL-based system to ingest syslog data from a Cisco ASA firewall. It covers editing the Wazuh ossec.conf, creating a dedicated log file, adjusting rsyslog rules, and verifying log ingestion for real-time network traffic monitoring.

#### [Logrotate Wazuh ASA.log](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Logrotate-Wazuh-ASA.log/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project outlines how to configure a custom logrotate policy on a RHEL-based Wazuh server to automatically rotate, compress, and manage the siteasa.log file that stores Cisco ASA firewall logs. It includes crontab scheduling for daily rotation and service restart handling to ensure uninterrupted log ingestion.

#### [Indexer Tuning and ISM Wazuh](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Indexer-Tuning-and-ISM-Wazuh/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project focuses on optimizing the Wazuh Indexer for a single-node setup by tuning shard counts, replica settings, index lifecycle policies (ISM), and increasing heap memory usage to avoid cluster overload and log ingestion issues.

#### [Wazuh Agent Deployment](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Wazuh-Agent-Deployment/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project provides step-by-step instructions for deploying and configuring Wazuh agents on endpoint machines and managing agent connections to the Wazuh Manager. It also covers agent removal using the CLI.

#### [Rancid-Installation-and-Script-Automation](https://github.com/Mario-CyberS/Rancid-Installation-and-Script-Automation/blob/main/README.md)
**Description:** This project explains how to create a Rancid user on the Wazuh server, set up automated daily backups of Cisco ASA running configurations using Rancid Tool, Expect scripting, Bash scripting, and crontab scheduling.
